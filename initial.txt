4) Design system requirements (design-oriented, non-negotiables)
Visual style

Editorial layout, strong typographic hierarchy, generous whitespace.

Aileron as primary font (you can pair with a serif for headlines if desired, but keep it intentional).

Grid: 12-column on desktop, 4–6 on mobile/tablet.

Components: cards, chips, badges, quote blocks, image rails, sticky TOC.

Interaction & motion

Hover states everywhere meaningful.

Page transitions subtle (fade/slide, 200–400ms).

Scroll reveal for sections (avoid heavy animations; keep it premium).

Accessibility

Contrast AA minimum.

Keyboard navigation for menus, modals, filters.

Alt text required in CMS for images.

Performance

Optimized images (next/image), lazy-loading galleries.

Minimal JS for content pages.

Avoid heavy animation libraries unless needed.

5) CMS plan (recommended content model)

Pick one:

Sanity (best for structured case studies, custom blocks, scalable)

Contentful (clean UI, strong editorial workflow)

Hygraph (GraphQL-first)

Notion as CMS (fast setup, less control)

MDX in repo (no external CMS; simplest, but not “CMS”)

If you want “real CMS” + design flexibility, Sanity is the best fit.
