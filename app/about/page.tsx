          I&apos;m Amrish a.k.a Tashya, a graphic designer with over 7 years of experience transforming complex ideas
          into clear, impactful visuals. My work spans branding, editorial, motion, and digital campaigns, often
          leading multidisciplinary teams and guiding projects from concept to execution.

          With a deep understanding of both design aesthetics and strategic thinking, I&apos;ve helped clients in
          finance, tech, and beyond craft visual stories that resonate.

          I believe great design does not just look good. It builds trust, sparks emotion, and delivers results.
